**TaskFlow — Project Showcase

- **Purpose:** Concise showcase document describing the tools, technologies, methods, main project goals, and user-facing features.

**Tools & Technologies**

- **Framework:** React — UI library used to build a component-driven interface.
- **Bundler / Dev Server:** Vite — fast dev server and build tool (`npm run dev`, `npm run build`).
- **UI & Styling:** Tailwind CSS with `tailwind.config.js` and PostCSS for utility-first styling.
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit (`@reduxjs/toolkit`) for slices and centralized state.
- **Side Effects / Async:** Redux Saga (`redux-saga`) to handle authentication flows and async tasks.
- **Routing:** React Router (`react-router-dom`) for SPA navigation.
- **Drag & Drop:** `@hello-pangea/dnd` for Kanban drag-and-drop interactions.
- **Forms & Validation:** `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers`, and `zod` for schema validation.
- **Icons:** `lucide-react` for lightweight SVG icon components.
- **React Query:** `@tanstack/react-query` for optional server state and caching.
- **Notifications:** `sonner` for in-app toast notifications.

**Project Structure (high level)**

- `src/`: Application source code (components, pages, hooks, store).
- `public/`: Static assets and favicon(s).
- `dist/`: Production build output (generated by `npm run build`).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts (archiving or maintenance helpers).
- Config files: `vite.config.ts`/`vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`.

**Core Methods & Functionalities**

- **Kanban Board:** Multi-column board with sections (columns) and tasks as cards.
  - Drag-and-drop tasks between sections using `@hello-pangea/dnd`.
  - Create, edit, rename, and delete sections and tasks.

- **Task Card Features:**
  - Title, description, due-date, priority or tags.
  - Quick actions like edit, move, favorite.

- **Search & Filtering:** Global search input syncs with state to filter tasks.

- **Favorites & Views:** Dedicated views (All Tasks, Favorites, Calendar) exposed via navigation.

- **Authentication Hooks:** Lightweight auth slice + saga flows to illustrate login/logout and token refresh handling. Session info stored in localStorage for persistence.

- **Toasts & Feedback:** `sonner` used to show success/error messages on async actions.

**Main Motto & Value Proposition**

- **Motto:** Make task management fast, focused, and enjoyable. TaskFlow provides a lightweight Kanban experience optimized for quick task creation, visual progress tracking, and easy reorganization.
- **Who benefits:** Individuals and small teams who want a simple, local-first Kanban web app with optional backend integrations.

**How to Run Locally**

- Install:

```bash
npm install --no-audit --no-fund
```

- Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# open the URL printed by Vite (default http://localhost:5173 or configured port)
```

- Build production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

- Preview built `dist/` locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

**Deployment Notes**

- The `dist/` folder contains static assets ready to be deployed to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, S3 + CloudFront, etc.).
- If you use a base path (e.g., GitHub Pages) set `base` in `vite.config.ts`.
- Invalidate CDN caches or replace `favicon.*` if icon changes are not visible due to aggressive caching.

**Maintenance & Customization Points**

- Remove or add Vite plugins in `vite.config.*` as needed.
- Update icons and branding in `public/` and `src/components/Header.jsx`.
- Add backend integrations by replacing local persistence with API calls and integrating `react-query` for server state.

**Files to Showcase (quick links)**

- Root layout & routes: `src/App.jsx`
- Kanban: `src/components/KanbanBoard.jsx`, `src/components/KanbanSection.jsx`, `src/components/TaskCard.jsx`
